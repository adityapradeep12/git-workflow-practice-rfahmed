The article I picked is: http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html

## Summary:
I find this article interesting because it changed my perspective on engineering. Previously I thought of my work as a software engineer as siloed and product focused, however Paul Graham writes about the importance of "hacking", and how applying creativity to your work as a developer is very important. I also find Paul Graham (founder of YC) as a person quite interesting so I enjoy reading his essays.
